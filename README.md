# Twist-Mono-Bilayer-Graphene-Band-Structure
\n Calculations in **continuum model**, mainly based on the Supplementary information of "Electrical switching of magnetic order in an orbital Chern insulator" by **A. F. Young**  to reproduce the band structure for twist monolayer-bilayer graphene. You can find this paper at "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2963-8"
\n The main body of the code is based on ZihaoPhys's tBLG code **"https://github.com/zihaophys/twisted_bilayer_graphene"** , with the Hamiltonian redefined according to paper mentioned above and some tricky details added. It can reproduce the content of Fig. 1 e-g in the paper as well as the subsequent DoS calculations.
